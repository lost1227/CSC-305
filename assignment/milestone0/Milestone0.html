BoardTest</b></font></p>
<h2 class="western">Overview</h2>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">For
this milestone you'll do a large-grained sort of TDD. Writing tests
before you code is an excellent way to be really sure you understand
what your program is supposed to do, and to plan its design with all
features in mind. And the testing portion of the first milestone
takes a big portion of the time, so getting it done in advance is a
good idea.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">To
start, first read the General Spec which includes behavior of the
various games, and also of the BoardTest scaffold we'll use to test
the games. Unit-level testing is often done with libraries that call
modules, e.g. classes and methods, directly, with expected results.
We may do some of this later in the term, but the design of our
board, move, etc classes is too sophisticated for you to write such
tests at this point. Instead, the BoardTest scaffold will supply a
simple text interface for writing your tests.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I'll
supply a working BoardTest executable for reference, to help clarify
the spec, and to let you verify that your test input files parse
correctly, etc. But note that the focus is on writing test inputs,
not on running my BoardTest. My BoardTest won't show any bugs (at
least I hope not). Imagine instead you were working just from the
General Spec and building input test cases for BoardTest based on
that, with no code written yet.</font></p>
<h3 class="western">Specific Steps</h3>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">0.
Review the testing guidelines from the course required reading</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">1.
Read carefully the General Spec, including the BoardTest application.
Be sure you understand thoroughly the command set for the BoardTest
application. </font>
</p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">2.
Run my example BoardTest program for each command, and for all three
board types.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">3.
Build several BoardTest input files (I have about 10 total) for
Checkers, C4Pop10, and Othello. Name your test files Checkers.#,
C4Pop10.#, or Othello.#, where # is a single digit from 0 to 5. You
<i>must </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">start
with 0 and number sequentially, e.g. C4Pop10.0, C4Pop10.1, etc.
</span></span>Generate sample output from my program for them and
check the sample output to be sure you understand it. Each test file
must run against my BoardTest in at most 0.1 second of CPU time. (Use
the “time” command to help with this.) And no test file may
result in an output exceeding 50 Kbytes.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Just
for example, here's a small Othello test input file. It makes a few
moves, displays the board, and shows the board's value. This might be
enough to catch some obvious bugs in apply moves, or tracking the
board value, but more sophisticated and complete testing would be
needed to catch subtler possible bugs.</font></p>

<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">4.
Turn all your test files in to turnin directory
</font><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i>~grade-cstaley/305/milestone0/turnin</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">.</font>
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Turn in at least one and at
most four test files of any particular game. Bender will run each of
your 3-12</font> <font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">test files
against a suite of 26 different faulty versions of BoardTest that
I’ve prepared. If any of your test files uncover a bug in one of
the faulty versions (i.e. if the output from the “good” BoardTest
I gave you differs from the output of the faulty version for one of
your test files) then that faulty version is “detected”.</font>
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">When your test files detect 21
of 26 faulty versions, you’ve passed.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">If
any test file takes more than 0.1 second to run against my correct
BoardTest, or if any test file causes my correct BoardTest to blow
up, or produces an output exceeding 50K bytes, then Bender will
reject the entire test suite with an appropriately acerbic Email, and
without further checking.</font></p>
<p class="msonormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Test
files may not depend upon one another, e.g. test file A may not
assume test file B has been previously run and has produced an output
file needed by test file A. Each test file must rely solely on the
game output files it has produced, if any. No test file may cause
more than 1000 moves to be run via testRun or testPlay, total.</font></p>

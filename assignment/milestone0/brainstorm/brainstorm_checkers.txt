2. Spaces may appear anywhere in the move except between the - and >
2a. Spaces may not appear between the - and >
3. Rows go from A to H
4. Columns go from 1 to 8

Board Value Calculation (.2)
- Piece count
    > No pieces
- Home row count
    > All on home row
    > None on home row
- Who's turn is it
    > White's turn
    > Black's turn
- King pieces
    > No kings
    > All kings

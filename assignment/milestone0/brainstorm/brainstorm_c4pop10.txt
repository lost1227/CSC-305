Edge cases
1. Take from column A
2. Take from column G
3. Place column A
4. Place column G
5. Keep from both ends of 4
6. Keep from middle of 4
~7. Keep from end of 4, against edge
~8. Keep from middle of 4, against edge
9. Keep from middle of 5
10. Keep from edge of 5
11. Take and replace self. E.g., column G contains only one disc and Take G place G.

Board Value Calculation (.2)
- Safe disks: If n(>=4) disks in a row on the bottom, vertically or horizontally, then n-3 disks are safe
    > 4 safe disks horizontally
    > 5 safe disks horizontally
    > 6 safe disks horizontally
    > 4 safe disks vertically
    > 5 safe disks vertically
    > 6 safe disks vertically
    > 4 safe disks horizontally and vertically
    > 5 safe disks horizontally and vertically
- Threat weight: If n(>=4) disks of other color in a row diagonally, with one on the bottom, then n-1 disks are threats
    Threats are disks that, if not addressed on this move, allow the opponent to keep a disk.
    > 4 threats, end at edge
    > 5 threats, start at edge
- Kept disks
- Turn

Board Value Calculation
- Clint says that this was particularly difficult
- Block of 4x4: many, many points

Testing advice
- Don't rely on random testing. It helps, but it's not likely to
uncover the more interesting/complicated bugs
- Quality of test is much more important than volume of test
- Ask yourself: What's going to be hard to code?
- Move formatting: test the regex.
- Don't test BoardTest's blocking invalid moves. Instead, use showBoard
to test the game's list of 
1. Don't test randomly
2. Think carefully about unusual cases
3. Carefully test aspects that you think would be hard to code
4. Read the spec carefully
- We can miss up to 7 bugs

Board and Move Keys (.3)

Moves A and B
A == B if
    A.type == B.type
    AND A.col == B.col

A > B if
    A.type > B.type (Pass, Place, Keep, TakePlace)
    OR A.col > B.col
    OR (if type == TakePlace) A.place_col > B.place_col

Boards A and B
A == B if foreach(A.square == B.square) AND A.next_player == B.next_player

A < B if
    OR foreach square in row-major order, A.first_diff < B.first_diff (empty, black, white)
